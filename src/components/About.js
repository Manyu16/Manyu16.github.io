                Iâ€™m a tech professional with a Computer Science background and two years of web development experience at Cognizant.
                Now pursuing an MS in Data Science at NJIT, I combine industry experience with analytics and AI skills. At Cognizant,
                I developed key applications for Verizon, including a real-time sensor management system and a 360-degree office navigation
                tool, strengthening my expertise in web development and user-focused design.
